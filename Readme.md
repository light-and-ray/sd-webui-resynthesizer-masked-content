# Resynthesizer as masked content

This extenstion for [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) adds new value of "Masked content" field in img2img -> inpaint tab. It uses Resynthesizer - a very old (2000 year) open-source equivalent to Adobe Photoshop's "Content-Aware Fill" feature

If you install [lama cleaner](https://github.com/light-and-ray/sd-webui-lama-cleaner-masked-content), "Yandere Inpaint" will appear as model in extras tab

Btw generally it's worse and slower then lama, but in a few scenarios if lama has some concepts which it can't remove, resynthesizer can help
